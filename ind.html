<h1>About this logo</h1>

<p>
  <div class="aboutlogo">This logo was created by Vincent Designs which is a creative marketing company located in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Canadian Geographic commissioned Vincent Designs to create a logo that represents the Indigenous people of Canada in a respectful way while also capturing the spirit of the First Nations, Inuit, and Metis groups. To create this logo, the designers consulted with First Nations, Inuit, and Metis partner and stakeholder groups to get a better understanding of their culture and essential elements to go into the design. They met with these indigenous groups as well as museum curators and historians to ensure their design choices will be culturally relevant and have meaning. The end design is incredibly successful and beautiful, as it showcases a mosaic design with each group being represented in itâ€™s elements. This logo is brought together by a circle which depicts a traditional medicine wheel as well as the four cardinal directions. This logo creates a new identity for the Indigenous people of Canada. It is an identity of unity, pride, strength, and resilience.</p>
