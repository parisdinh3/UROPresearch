      <div class="aboutlogo">This logo represents the city of Montreal, and it has come to be an incredibly symbolic and significant emblem for the city. This design is connected and derived from the Canadian Coat of Arms. The design itself resembles a flower, and the four petals of the flower have the letters V and M within, which are the initials for "Ville de Montreal".
