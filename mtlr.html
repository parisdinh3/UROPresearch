      <div class="aboutlogo">This logo represents the city of Montreal: it has come to be an deeply symbolic and significant emblem for the city. This design is connected to and derived from the Canadian Coat of Arms. The design itself resembles a flower, with the four petals of the flower containing the letters V and M within, which are the initials for "Ville de Montréal". Each line has a purpose within this logo which is why I appreciate it so much. The four heart shapes signify a flower in whole but the heart shapes themselves explicitly represent hearts, i.e., the symbolic representation of love and kindness. The hearts express the love Montrealers have for their city  They are widely displayed in Montreal street art, signs, and designs. The intersecting lines in the middle of the logo mirror the city's designation as a prime location of communication and civilization. In 2003, the city council approved the recommendation to revamp the city's visual signage with a new identity and distinction. The approved 2003 design is the streamlined version of the 1981 logo by the Graphic Design firm, Georges Huel et Associés Inc. Since this logo is an institutional signature, only the municipal administration, its paramunicipal organizations and project partners are authorized to  use it. Any other organizations, businesses, and individuals etc. must seek permission before using it. Ainsi, je remercie la Ville de Montreal pour son soutien et merci de m'avoir permis d'utiliser ce logo dans mon travail.
