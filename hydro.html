  <h1><b>ABOUT THIS LOGO</b></h1>

  <p>
  <div class="padding">
  <div class="aboutlogo">This logo is strongly connected to the Quiet Revolution, which was a period of intense government secularization, socio-political and culural change, and the start of an "etat providence" or a state-run welfare state. The Union Nationale party (a conservative quebecois political party that aligned with Quebecois autonomism) was one of the centers for the anachrononistic ideologies that were running Quebec in that time. After the Lesage administration gained control, a nationalist mindset settled in, and the HydroQuebec project became a product of this growing period of nationalizing industries.</p>
