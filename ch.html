<div class="aboutlogo">"Le Club de Hockey Canadien" or the Montreal Canadiens is the oldest playing team in the NHL. The team was established by John Ambrose O'Brian, the founder of the National Hockey Association, in 1909 to capture Francophone Montrealersâ€™ interest in ice hockey. In the early 20th century, most of Quebec's French speaking population was in a lower social class. Therefore,the local hockey teams belonged to the English speaking bourgeousie and there weren't many or any French speakers on the teams. This is why O'Brian chose to create a hockey club with only French speaking players. The way the team spelled their name,"Canadien" alludes the teams connection to Montreal's working class.
