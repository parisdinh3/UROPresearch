  <h1><b>ABOUT THIS LOGO</b></h1>

  <div class="padding">
  <div class="aboutlogo">This logo is strongly connected to the Quiet Revolution, which was a period of intense government secularization, socio-political and culural change, and the start of an "etat providence" or a state-run welfare state. The Union Nationale party (a conservative quebecois political party that aligned with Quebecois autonomism) was one of the centers for the anachrononistic ideologies that were running Quebec in that time. After the Lesage administration gained control, a nationalist mindset settled in, and the HydroQuebec project became a product of this growing period of nationalizing industries and economic reform. Hydroquebec became a government owned hydroelectric generating company and as of 2019, according to NS Energy,it is considered one of the top three hyroelectric companies in the world. NS Energy measured HydroQuebec to have <a><a href="https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/features/largest-hydropower-companies/">"An installed hydropower capacity of 36,767MW generated from 63 hydroelectric stations across the Canadian state."</a> Besides becoming a significant symbol in Quebec, HydroQuebec was also one of the public institutions to expand Quebec's economic autonomy. Even today, HydroQuebec contributes greatly to the province's economy, with <a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet_Revolution">"annual revenues of 12.7 billion Canadian dollars".</a> The logo itself was created by the Montreal Firm, Gagnon/Valkus, Inc. in 1960. The clean lightning bolt within the Q is meant to represent the company's strong role in electricity. The distinctive orange embodies the energy and spirit of the sun. The blue is meant to symbolize excellence and class(dark blues are commonly used by companies because it's commonly seen by human brains as a trusting color). This powerful logo packs a historical punch despite it's simplistic design.</p>

        <h2>1960</h2>
        <p>June 22, 1960, the liberal party under Jean Lesage won the election and the Union Nationale party no longer had complete control. The Quebec Liberal Party had plans for major reform to try to transform and <a><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Quiet-Revolution">"redefine the role of francophone society in Canada."</a></p>

        <h2>1964</h2>
        <p>The democratization of education started in 1964 with the creation of the Ministry of Education. The education system started to become more secularized and not as reliant on the Catholic Church. The Liberal Government created a plan to make education more accessible and modern. At the time, not many children were going to school, and traditional, conservative teaching was widespread. The old education system no longer served Quebec's evolving society's needs.</p>

        <h2>1982</h2>
        <p> The Canada Act of 1982, is an instrumental document for Canada gaining full independence because it allowed Canada to amend it's Constitution without Britain's approval. Of equal importance, the act also manifested the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which is the most recognizable part of Canada's Constituion. It outlines the rights of Canada's individuals, and the Charter ultimately is deemed, "the highest law of the land".Before this act, Britain kept autonomy over Canada's Constitution until Canada figured out what their legislation would be like, which branch of government should have a say in changing it, and how changing it would affect the various provinces. </p>
