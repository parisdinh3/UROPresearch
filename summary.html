  <h1><b>MY CONCLUSIONS</b></h1>


  <p>
  <div class="padding">
  <div class="aboutlogo">Through my research, I've become more aquainted with Quebec history and culture. I've tried to analyze how these aspects influence their contemporary art, specifically logos and graphic designs. The logos are art themselves and the interesting thing in my opinion is that these pieces of art are more publicized than other physical art forms. These logos will be shared, spreading culture, historical context, and overall, I believe them to be examples of post-modernity. The designs embody multiple cultures and identities within them while also communicating the aesthetics of todays world. Logos strive to be simple and easily communicated, and I think the logos I decided to showcase exhibit these modern characteristics. With the <b><i>Indigenous People of Canada</i></b> logo, it is interesting to see how traditional Indigenous artistic factors went into creating a sleek, modern logo. I really appreciated how the designers incorporated meaninful symbols into this design that represented the different Indigenous peoples. Many Indigenous peoples in Canada have been westernized, culturally assimilated, and discriminated against. Due to this long process of cultural assimilation, many Indigenous peoples are no longer connected to their culture or they have no pride for it. This leads into another reason why I love this logo, because there is so much pride and resilience within it. Indigenous people have a huge impact on Canada's culture and history. They are not only the first people on the land, but their presence created negative controversial struggles which bled into modern day politics, media, and arts. There is so much more history and current events I could've incorporated into this logo's page, but this website is a place where I hope to grow and it is where I will continually update and add in information in the future.

  The <i><b>Montreal Canadiens</i></b> are a significant part of Montreal culture. They bring communitas because a lot of people look up to them and they bring many people together from different walks of life to celebrate a common experience. They celebrate the French community and have come to represent them.

  I think Montreal's logo is very unique, not only due to it's simple symbolic success but also because not every city creates a specialized identity for themselves.
