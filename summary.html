  <h1><b>MY CONCLUSIONS</b></h1>


  <p>
  <div class="padding">
  <div class="aboutlogo">Through my artistic research, I've become more aquainted with Quebec history and culture. I've tried to analyze how these aspects influence their contemporary art, specifically logos and graphic designs. The logos are art themselves and the interesting thing in my opinion is that these pieces of art are more publicized than other physical art forms. These logos will be shared, spreading culture, historical context, and overall, I believe them to be examples of post-modernity. The designs embody multiple cultures and identities within them while also communicating the aesthetics of todays world. Logos strive to be simple and easily communicated, and I think the logos I decided to showcase exhibit these modern characteristics. With the <b><i>Indigenous People of Canada</i></b> logo, it is interesting to see how traditional Indigenous artistic factors went into creating a sleek, modern logo. I really appreciated how the designers incorporated meaninful symbols into this design that represented the different Indigenous peoples. Many Indigenous peoples in Canada have been westernized, culturally assimilated, and discriminated against. Due to this long process of cultural assimilation, many Indigenous peoples are no longer connected to their culture or they have no pride for it. This leads into another reason why I love this logo, because there is so much pride and resilience within it. Indigenous people have a huge impact on Canada's culture and history. They are not only the first people on the land, but their presence created negative controversial struggles which bled into modern day politics, media, and arts. There is so much more history and current events I could've incorporated into this logo's page, but this website is a place where I hope to grow and it is where I will continually update and add in information in the future.

  The <i><b>Montreal Canadiens</i></b> are a significant part of Montreal culture. They bring communitas because a lot of people look up to them and they bring many people together from different walks of life to celebrate a common experience. They celebrate the French community and have come to represent them. Like Football in the United States, Hockey has similar effects in Canada. Cultural events occur due to these exciting, inclusive community activities, and as a result they become a part of tradition that will be passed on to later generations. Sports in general give people something to connect with and hold onto. Somebody could be born decades later after the creation of the team, but by choosing to support and be a part of the community the sport fosters, they are now a part of a bigger picture. They now have connections to more parts of history, local and global events, communitas,  the teams highs and lows, the people on the team, fellow supporters, team apparel, etc. Choosing to belong to a cultural community opens people up to new worlds, traditions, rules, and history. The logo plays just as notable of a role in this, because they give everything I listed a face. When people think of or say Montreal Canadiens, the logo might pop up for a lot of people. This simple design, like humans, goes through a design evolution with the aspirations of becoming the most useful. Each logo of the time period fits that time periods aesthetics and purposes. The logo we use today does the same, it's simple and modern yet classical and bold. It can allow people to reminisce while also feeling it accurately represents our contemporary times. The logo excites people, hypes them up, it reassures people, reminds them of home. Nothing is nothing without a face, a brand. Everything needs a strong visual to make it memorable.

  I think <i><b>Montreal's logo</i></b> is very unique, not only due to it's simple symbolic success but also because not every city creates a specialized identity for themselves. The love that Montrealers have for their city is shown within the creation of this logo. The city itself felt they needed to distinguish themselves and give themselves an aesthetic identity, a brand. The drive to create this local identity is what is interesting. This logo is seen on government property, but it is also a beloved design that artists love to incorporate, and other businesses/organizations want permission to use.
