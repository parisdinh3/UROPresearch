  <h1><b>MY CONCLUSIONS</b></h1>

  <div class="aboutlogo">This website is the culmination of my artistic/historical research, as well as the showcase of my learning experiences over this past year. Within my artistic research, I've become more aquainted with Quebec history and culture. Discovering the strong influences of Quebec's people, culture, and history within their visual culture was truly fascinating to learn about. I've tried to analyze how these aspects influence their contemporary art, specifically logos and graphic designs. The logos are art themselves and the interesting thing in my opinion is that these pieces of art are more publicized than other physical art forms. These logos will be shared, spreading culture, historical context, and overall, I believe them to be examples of post-modernity. The designs embody multiple cultures and identities within them while also communicating the aesthetics of todays world. Logos strive to be simple and easily communicated, and I think the logos I decided to showcase exhibit these modern characteristics.

  What truly is the purpose of logos in a society? Besides communicating a company or invidual's intentions, and subcommunicating a broader history, how else does a logo contribute to social compleixities and the art world as a whole? Within this project, I have been trying to dive deeper into the impacts of Graphic Design.
