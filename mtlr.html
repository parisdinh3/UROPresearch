      <h1><b>ABOUT THIS LOGO</b></h1>

      <p>
      <div class="padding">
      <div class="aboutlogo">This logo represents the city of Montreal, and it has come to be an incredibly symbolic and significant emblem for the city. This design is connected and derived from the Canadian Coat of Arms. The design itself resembles a flower, and the four petals of the flower have the letters V and M within, which are the initials for "Ville de Montreal". Each line has a purpose within this logo which is why I appreciate it so much. The four heart shapes signify a flower in whole but the heart shapes themselves explicitly represent hearts. The hearts express the love Montrealers have for their city, and this is often reflected in Montreal street art, signs, and designs. The intersecting lines in the middle of the logo mirrors the city's purpose as a prime location of communication and civilization. In 2003, the Montreal city council approved a reccomendation to revamp the citys visual identity and to give the city a new identity and distinction. The approved 2003 design is the streamlined version of the 1981 logo by the Graphic Design firm, Georges Huel et Associ√©s Inc. Since this logo is an institutional signature, only the municipal administration, its paramunicipal organizations and project partners can use it. Any other organizations, businesses, and individuals etc. must ask for permission before using it.

      Je remercie la Ville de Montreal pour son soutien et merci de m'avoir permis d'utiliser ce logo dans ma travail.
