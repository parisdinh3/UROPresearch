  <h1><br>MY CONCLUSIONS<br></h1>


  <p>
  <div class="padding">
  <div class="aboutlogo">Through my research, I've become more aquainted with Quebec history and culture. I've tried to analyze how these aspects influence their contemporary art, specifically logos and graphic designs. The logos are art themselves and the interesting thing in my opinion is that these pieces of art are more publicized than other physical art forms. These logos will be shared, spreading culture, historical context, and overall, I believe them to be examples of post-modernity. The designs embody multiple cultures and identities within them while also communicating the aesthetics of todays world. Logos strive to be simple and easily communicated, and I think the logos I decided to showcase exhibit these characteristics.
