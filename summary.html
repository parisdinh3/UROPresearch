  <h1><b>MY CONCLUSIONS</b></h1>


  <p>
  <div class="padding">
  <div class="aboutlogo"><p>This website is the culmination of my artistic/historical research, as well as the showcase of my learning experiences over this past year. Within my artistic research, I've become more aquainted with Quebec history and culture. Discovering the strong influences of Quebec's people, culture, and history within their visual culture was truly fascinating to learn about. I've tried to analyze how these aspects influence their contemporary art, specifically logos and graphic designs. As a Graphic Design student myself, I have become captivated by the social power of logos. The word 'logos' first appeared in theological terms, meaning a principle of divine reason and creative order, and it's greek definition means word or reason. Why did we, as a society, reuse this word to describe symbols that are the unifying visual identity of organizations and individuals? Perhaps there is a connection between modern day logos and the "creative order and word of reason" that was described in the Bible. This project isn't religious oriented in any way, but the reason why this biblical concept could have an impact on my research is because of my focus on using linguistics and historical contexts to formulate my findings.

     With this in mind, I have always had an interest in history and anthropology growing up, but after choosing art as my field, I have been trying to integrate these different studies. After receiving this research grant, I felt I had an opportunity to explore more deeply how logos impact communities, along with analyzing the complex historical context of digital symbols. Choosing to base my research in Quebec (a French speaking province) was to bring another dimension to my work. My work revolves around analyzing a visual culture. My choice to explore the visual culture of a community with a different language and location than my own, pushed me to analyze from a more outside and raw perspective. I was learning history through other designers eyes. Being able to learn from this viewpoint, helped me rethink my position as a Graphic Designer. I used to think our job was to market, and to simplify, in order to make things more visually appealing and easy to read. However, my time researching the historical context of logos in Quebec has completely rewired my frame of mind as a graphic designer. I started to see the designers intentions and choices after analyzing the context of each of the logos. These choices communicate the position the Graphic Designer was in. Many times, I began to understand that a certain logo is the bridge of communication between a community to the rest of society. The logo is the dissemination of the community's culture and intentions. It is the Graphic Designer's job to interpret and problem solve.[go into our job is interpretation, problem solving, a bridge of communication between a specific community and society, communication heavy context in simple terms, educating, informing]
    <br>
    <br>The logos are art themselves and the interesting thing in my opinion is that these pieces of art are more publicized than any other physical art forms. These logos will be shared, spreading culture, historical context, and overall, I believe them to be examples of post-modernity. The designs embody multiple cultures and identities within them while also communicating the aesthetics of todays world. Logos strive to be simple and easily communicated, and I think the logos I decided to showcase exhibit these modern characteristics.

    <br>
  What truly is the purpose of logos in a society? Besides communicating a company or invidual's intentions, and subcommunicating a broader history, how else does a logo contribute to social compleixities and the art world as a whole? Within this project, I have been trying to dive deeper into the impacts of Graphic Design.

  This was an interesting experience for me, because over the past year, I have been learning how to teach French language students through visual tools such as infographics and web design. With my mentor, Dr. Kathryn Murphy-Judy, I help her bring aesthetics into language curation. My experience with Dr. Kathryn Murphy Judy inspired me to make my project into a teaching tool. Over the summer, I took a web design class, and that completely changed my mind about the direction of my project. I wanted to utilize what I learned, and create a website where anyone can easily access my research. This website will be a longterm project where I will continue to foster it's content, add information, and improve my coding.</p>
