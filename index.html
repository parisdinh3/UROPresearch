    <div class="aboutbox"> Within this website, I will be exploring the sociocultural aspects of anthropology by studying how French Canadian graphic design uses it's own social and political history to form the nations cultural identity through contemporary design and logos. With Graphic Design becoming a prevalent art form and expression, I feel like it is relevant to analyze the effects of Graphic Design from an anthropological perspective. Feel free to click on the Explore button to see my research, and before you leave click on the Summary button to see my anthropological conclusions. Happy exploring!</p>
